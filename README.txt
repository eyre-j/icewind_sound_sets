==============================================================================
OVERVIEW
==============================================================================
This modification makes forty-two player character sound sets from Icewind
Dale and Icewind Dale II available for use in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate
II.  Optionally, subtitles for the sound sets are available for installation on
Baldur's Gate II games with the Throne of Bhaal Expansion installed.  English
is the only supported language.


==============================================================================
COMPATIBILITY
==============================================================================
This mod is designed to be compatible with the original "classic" Baldur's
Gate and Baldur's Gate II game engines.  Installing this mod on Enhanced
Edition games is not supported.

The following games are supported:
- Baldur's Gate (with or without the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion)
- Baldur's Gate II (with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion)
- Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT-WeiDU)
- Baldur's Gate Tutu (EasyTutu)
- Classic Adventures
- Icewind Dale in BG2


==============================================================================
COMPONENTS
==============================================================================
The following components are available for installation:

Component: Player character sounds from Icewind Dale/Icewind Dale II
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This component copies the sound resource files to the game's sounds directory.
Due to the differences among the sound sets between the two series, some
compromises have been made in order to allow as many distinct sounds to be
heard while also taking into account how appropriate a particular sound clip
is for a given sound slot.  In that vein, some minor adjustments have been
made to a few select sound clips in order to better mesh thematically with the
context in which this mod employs them in the Baldur's Gate series.


Component: Subtitles for Icewind Dale/Icewind Dale II sound sets
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This optional component installs subtitles for the sound set files installed
by the previous component.  This is only offered for Baldur's Gate II games
with the Throne of Bhaal expansion installed.  Installation of the previous
component is a prerequisite.  Note that this component requires the Throne of
Bhaal Extender (TobEx) to function.  TobEx will be installed automatically if
necessary.


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION
==============================================================================
This is a WeiDU mod, and installation is easy.  First, extract the contents
of the archive into your game directory.  The next step is operating system
dependent:
 * Windows users should execute the "setup-icewind_sound_sets" file.
 * Linux users should run 'weinstall icewind_sound_sets' from a
   terminal emulator. Note that 'weinstall' must be on your path.
Finally, follow the instructions of the command line interface to select and
install the desired mod components.


==============================================================================
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
==============================================================================
The original inspiriation for this mod can be traced to the Faster Baldur's
Gate mod by eirinjas, which contains sound sets from the Icewind Dale series.
I have used that mod previously and warmly recommend checking it out if you
are playing the original Baldur's Gate.  The sound set clips used by this mod
are not identical to that one, but should be reasonably similar.

Ascension64's TobEx is an ingenious piece of engineering that allows for
modding possibilities that aren't accessible with the vanilla game.  This mod
makes use of the TobEx feature that allows character sound sets to be
associated with string references in order to display subtitles.
